## SVM compared to other models

SVM and logistic regression performed identically.
They had decent accuracy, but failed to identify the majority of positives.
However, when a positive was identified it was always correct.

Random Forest and Decision Tree identified more positives but with loewr accuracy.
Decision Tree identified the most positives but at the lowest accuracy.

Random Forest seems to perform best overall but did not have particularly high correct positive identification.
However, it had the best identification of the models that actually identified positives.
